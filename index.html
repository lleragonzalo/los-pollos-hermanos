      <h1 class="welcome">Welcome to the Landings Squad's<br>Fever Code Challenge</h1>
      <p>
        Before you start, make sure you have read these files carefully and in the following order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>README.md</li>
        <li>PRD.pdf</li>
      </ol>
      <p>They explain how this project works and what the test will consist of.
      As you navigate through the different files you will find two types of messages:
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Informative messages</strong> that will inform you which areas of the project can be edited and which cannot. You can see them at the top of the files, if there is no message indicating it, it can be edited. (this does not mean that it should be done).</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Code Hints</strong> that will give you useful advice during the development of your test.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Inside <code>package.json</code> you can find the only three commands you will need to do this test.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"dev" will open a development environment where you can see the changes you make in real time.</li>
        <br>
        <li>"build" will compile what you've built and generate a dist folder with your final web page.</li>
        <br>
        <li>"preview" will allow you to view that dist folder as if it were a real production environment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you submit your test, we'll use that last command to generate your static web page and test you, so it's important to make sure everything is working properly.</p>
      <p>Good luck! &#128578;</p>
